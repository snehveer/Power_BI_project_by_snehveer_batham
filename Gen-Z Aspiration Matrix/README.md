**About the Project:**

This repository contains a dataset representing Gen Z data about their job and learning preferences. The dataset includes information such as influential factors, working in laid-off companies, career options, and much more.

**Problem Statement:**

As employers and educators, it is essential to understand the career aspirations of Gen Z, as they enter the workforce with unique values, expectations, and goals. Understanding their career aspirations is crucial for effectively supporting and engaging with this emerging talent pool. Our project aims to shed light on their career aspirations and provide valuable insights through our Power BI dashboard.

**Recommended Analysis:**

To achieve our goals, we conducted primary research to collect relevant data. We used Excel and Power Query to clean the data by removing duplicates and unwanted entries and standardized it for analysis. By utilizing slicers, we were able to provide multiple views of the data. Finally, we created a Power BI dashboard to visualize and present the generated insights.
